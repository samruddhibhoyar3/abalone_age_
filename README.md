# abalone_age_
The objective of the project is to predict the age of abalone from the physical measurement. As usually the age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it and counting the number of rings through microscope which is very time consuming. Thus predicting the age and classifying them by comparing the accuracy of various models.
